# Gearbox

A library of components built using the Surface Library. Currently compatible with LiveView only.
The gearbox library is developed primary for use on the Gearflow.com platform, but the aim is to create components that are strictly presentational and isolated from any business logic used on Gearflow.com
Thus, anyone should be able to use Gearbox components on their own projects.

### Requirements
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Alpine.JS for minor UI interactions.
